    Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution: To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

## Problem Set 3

- Read the following documents for discussion at our next class and to give you ideas for final projects:
    - Shulman, Seth. "When Patenting Works." *The Technology Review* (July/August 2002).
    - Global School District Patent
- Use the readings and your own assessment to determine the intellectual property regarding software.
    - Is software an invention?
    - Should it be copyrighted?
    - Should it be patentable?

({{% resource_link "e5ee232d-2990-10fa-c089-6fe980023b5a" "PDF" %}})

({{% resource_link "e5ee232d-2990-10fa-c089-6fe980023b5a" "PDF" %}})
- This week's discussion relates to patenting emerging areas of science. Discuss the following topics:
    - Should the U.S. allow patents for genetically modified animals and/or living organisms?
    - Should the U.S. Supreme Court rethink its "anything under the sun" policy regarding patentability?
    - Why? Is it to promote innovation? Or will people still take the risk to develop these new technologies even without the protections afforded by the patent system.
- Extra Credit: Come to class with a list of four items which you think every United States citizen should be compelled to abide by in order to retain citizenship. (If you believe that there are four items.)

## Problem Set 6

- Writing a Claim: Write a claim for a patent on a basic chair. Try to make the claim cover many possibilities.
- What are four basic actions every U.S. Citizen should do in order to retain citizenship?
- Should patents be allowed for genetically modified plants/animals?
- Should "anything under the sun" be patentable (from last week)?
